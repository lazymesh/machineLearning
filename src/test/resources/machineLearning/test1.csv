Term Term frequency-inverse document frequency frequency
used in text mining to reflect the importance of a term to a document in the corpus.
Denote a term by t, a document by d, and the corpus by D. Term frequency TF(t,d) is
the number of times that term t appears in document d, while document frequency DF(t,D)
is the number of documents that contains term t. If we only use term frequency to measure
the importance, it is very easy to over-emphasize terms that appear very often but carry
little information about the document, e.g., “a”, “the”, and “of”. If a term appears very
often across the corpus, it means it doesn’t carry special information about a particular document.
Inverse document frequency is a numerical measure of how much information a term provides:
